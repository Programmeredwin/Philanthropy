    Kiambu Integrated Rescue Disabled Organization (KIRDO) has played a transformative role in the life of an autistic young man, empowering him to achieve remarkable milestones in his personal care and independence. Through their dedicated support and specialized programs, KIRDO has provided him with the skills and confidence needed to perform extraordinary tasks that many might find challenging. Notably, he has learned to give himself a haircut and perform his own pedicures—activities that require precision, coordination, and self-reliance. These achievements not only highlight his personal growth but also underscore the impact of KIRDO’s tailored approach in fostering independence and enhancing the quality of life for individuals with disabilities.</p>
